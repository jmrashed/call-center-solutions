## üõ†Ô∏è **Call Center Terms and Concepts**

### Glossary of Key Terms:
1. **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**  
   A system to manage customer interactions and data, enhancing sales and service efficiency.

2. **ACD (Automatic Call Distribution)**  
   Routes incoming calls to the most suitable agent based on pre-configured rules.

3. **IVR (Interactive Voice Response)**  
   Automates call handling with menu options and inputs via voice or keypad.

4. **CTI (Computer Telephony Integration)**  
   Links phone systems with computers for advanced features like click-to-call and caller info display.

5. **PBX (Private Branch Exchange)**  
   A private telephone network for handling internal and external calls in an organization.

6. **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**  
   Facilitates real-time communications such as voice, video, and messaging over IP.

7. **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**  
   Transmits voice communication over the internet, reducing costs and increasing scalability.

8. **FXO & FXS (Foreign Exchange Office & Station)**  
   Interfaces for connecting PBX systems with analog lines and devices.

9. **QoS (Quality of Service)**  
   Ensures high-quality audio by managing telecommunication network traffic.

10. **DID (Direct Inward Dialing)**  
    Enables callers to connect directly to specific extensions.

11. **UC (Unified Communications)**  
    Combines various communication methods like voice, video, and messaging into a single platform.

12. **TTS & ASR (Text-to-Speech & Automatic Speech Recognition)**  
    Converts text to speech or recognizes spoken language for automation and accessibility.

13. **API (Application Programming Interface)**  
    Allows integration between call center systems and third-party applications.

14. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**  
    Cloud hosting services commonly used for scalable telephony solutions.

15. **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**  
    Ensures fast and reliable data transmission across networks.

16. **KPI & NPS (Key Performance Indicator & Net Promoter Score)**  
    Metrics to measure call center performance and customer satisfaction.

17. **ANI (Automatic Number Identification)**  
    Identifies the caller's number for routing or tracking purposes.

## üåê **Call Flow Architectures**

### Inbound Call Flow
1. Caller dials the organization‚Äôs number.
2. **BTCL Lines ‚Üí FXO Gateway ‚Üí PBX ‚Üí IVR**.
3. Calls are routed to the appropriate agent or department.

### Outbound Call Flow
1. Agent initiates a call from the PBX system.
2. **PBX ‚Üí FXO Gateway ‚Üí BTCL Lines**.

### Inter-Branch Communication
1. SIP Trunking connects branch PBXs to the main system.
2. Internal calls are routed through secure SIP protocols.

## üöÄ **Key Features of Call Center Systems**
- **Scalability**: Handle increased call volume or integrate new branches effortlessly.
- **Reliability**: Maintain operations even during internet downtimes with local PBX systems.
- **Security**: On-premise telephony solutions minimize external vulnerabilities.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce communication costs using VoIP and optimized routing.
